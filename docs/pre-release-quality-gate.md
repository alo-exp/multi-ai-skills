# Pre-Release Quality Gate

Before ANY release (`/create-release`), the following four-stage quality gate MUST
be completed in order. Each stage has its own completion criteria. Skipping a stage
or declaring it complete without meeting the criteria is a violation.

**IMPORTANT**: This gate runs AFTER the normal workflow finalization steps (testing,
documentation, branch cleanup, deploy checklist) and BEFORE `/create-release`.
The `/create-release` skill will not be invoked until all four stages pass.

---

## Stage 1 — Code Review Triad

Run all three review skills in sequence, then fix all issues. Repeat until clean.

1. Invoke `/code-review` (Engineering) — structured quality review: security, performance, correctness, maintainability
2. Invoke `/requesting-code-review` — dispatches `superpowers:code-reviewer` automated reviewer
3. Invoke `/receiving-code-review` — triage combined feedback from steps 1–2
4. Fix all accepted issues
5. **Loop**: repeat steps 1–4 until `/receiving-code-review` produces zero accepted items
6. **MANDATORY — invoke `/superpowers:verification-before-completion`** via the Skill tool.
   Running verification commands manually is NOT a substitute for invoking this skill.
   You need BOTH: (a) run the actual verification commands, AND (b) invoke the skill so
   `record-skill.sh` tracks it. If you ran tests/CI/checks but did not invoke the skill,
   you have NOT completed this step. Do NOT record the stage marker until BOTH are done.
7. Record stage completion: `echo "quality-gate-stage-1" >> ~/.claude/.silver-bullet/state`

## Stage 2 — Big-Picture Consistency Audit

Review the entire plugin for cross-file inconsistencies, redundancies, and contradictions.

1. Dispatch parallel Explore agents across five dimensions:
   - **Workflows**: full-dev-cycle.md vs CLAUDE.md
   - **Skills**: all SKILL.md files — obsolete references, redundant work, contradictions
   - **Hooks + config**: .sh files, hooks.json, .silver-bullet.json, templates
   - **Help site + README**: HTML pages, search.js, README.md — step counts, paths, versions
   - **Cross-plugin consistency**: read 100% of skill content from all 4 dependency plugins —
     GSD: `~/.claude/get-shit-done/` workflows/references/templates;
     Superpowers: `~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/superpowers/*/skills/*/SKILL.md`;
     Engineering: `~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/knowledge-work-plugins/*/engineering/skills/*/SKILL.md`;
     Design: `~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/knowledge-work-plugins/*/design/skills/*/SKILL.md` —
     check for contradictions, conflicts, inconsistencies, or redundancies between Silver Bullet
     instructions and upstream plugin skills
2. Fix all genuine issues found
3. **Loop**: repeat until two consecutive audit passes find zero issues
4. **MANDATORY — invoke `/superpowers:verification-before-completion`** via the Skill tool.
   Do NOT record the stage marker without invoking this skill first.
5. Record stage completion: `echo "quality-gate-stage-2" >> ~/.claude/.silver-bullet/state`

---

## Stage 3 — Public-Facing Content Refresh

Verify and update all user-visible surfaces to reflect the current state.

1. Audit for factual accuracy:
   - GitHub repo description and topics (`gh repo edit`)
   - README.md (version, step counts, enforcement layers, state paths, architecture)
   - Landing page (`site/index.html`)
   - All help pages (`site/help/*/index.html`)
   - Search index (`site/help/search.js`)
   - Compare page (`site/compare/index.html`) if it exists
2. Fix all discrepancies
3. **MANDATORY — invoke `/superpowers:verification-before-completion`** via the Skill tool.
   Do NOT record the stage marker without invoking this skill first.
4. Push and confirm CI green
5. Record stage completion: `echo "quality-gate-stage-3" >> ~/.claude/.silver-bullet/state`

---

## Stage 4 — Security Audit (SENTINEL)

Run the SENTINEL v2.3 adversarial security audit against the full plugin.

1. Invoke `/anthropic-skills:audit-security-of-skill` targeting the plugin root
2. Fix all findings (Critical, High, Medium; Low at discretion)
3. Re-run the audit
4. **Loop**: repeat until two consecutive audit passes find zero issues
5. **MANDATORY — invoke `/superpowers:verification-before-completion`** via the Skill tool.
   Do NOT record the stage marker without invoking this skill first.
6. Record stage completion: `echo "quality-gate-stage-4" >> ~/.claude/.silver-bullet/state`

---

## Enforcement

The completion audit hook (`hooks/completion-audit.sh`) blocks `gh release create`
until all required workflow skills AND quality gate stage markers are recorded in
the state file (`~/.claude/.silver-bullet/state`). Required markers:

- Stage 1: `quality-gate-stage-1`
- Stage 2: `quality-gate-stage-2`
- Stage 3: `quality-gate-stage-3`
- Stage 4: `quality-gate-stage-4`

**Session reset:** The `session-start` hook clears all `quality-gate-stage-*` markers
at the beginning of every session. Each release cycle must earn its own gate pass —
stale markers from a previous session cannot satisfy the gate for a new release.

> **Anti-Skip:** You are violating this rule if you release without running all 4 stages
> in the CURRENT session. Stale markers from a prior session are automatically cleared.

> **Anti-Skip:** You are violating this rule if you attempt `/create-release` without all
> four `quality-gate-stage-N` markers in the state file. `completion-audit.sh` will block
> the release. Each stage requires explicit `/superpowers:verification-before-completion`
> invocation — the marker alone is insufficient.

If any stage surfaces a blocker that cannot be resolved (e.g., upstream dependency
issue, ambiguous design decision), log it under "Needs human review" and surface
to the user before proceeding to the next stage.
